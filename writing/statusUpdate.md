#### Progress Report

##### Project Subject

##### Main Questions to Address
1) Africa's Real GDP Growth rate seemed to steadily increase for a few decades, but then it took a downturn. When did this downturn occur and why?
2) Do countries with higher GDP growth/GDP per capita have higher Happy Planet Indexes (representing citizen happiness)?
3) Is there a correlation between living standards and GDP per capita?
4) Are countries that live in a specific region overall happier than countries that don't live in that region? (i.e. Sub-Saharan Africa and MENA)
5)

##### Data Citations and References
In order to research our subject and answer our questions, we had to find data from a number of sources:
- [Happy Planet Index](http://happyplanetindex.org): Contains information about how happy citizens are living in their respective countries. Also provides valuable insights into life expectancy, wellness, and more in Africa.
- [World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/data/source/africa-development-indicators#): This type of information contains the GDP (gross Domestic Products) and GDP per Capita (in current $USD) of all of the African countries between 2000 and 2012. This gives us an insight of the type of healthcare these African countries have and their standards of living.
- [IMF - Real GDP Growth in Africa](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD): Contains information about Africa's real GDP growth over the last few decades.

Additionally, we completed research outside the data about Africa and found references that support the motivation of our project,
##### Steps Already Taken
We have completed a variety of tasks since beginning this project. They are detailed in the list below:
- Came up with project subject.
- Did background research into our subject
- Found 4 datasets.
- Began to import datasets into and write code for our SQLite3 database.
- Came up with questions & wrote the Status Update.

##### Steps Left to Complete
Though we have completed a variety of tasks since beginning this project, we still have a variety of tasks left to complete. They are detailed in the list below:
- Consider finding more datasets.
- Consider narrowing down questions.
- Add all datasets into the SQLite3 database.
- Write queries and complete research to answer questions.
- Presentation and Report.
